- [ ] Now we store an Item, that have an ItemKey internally. Is it really the best thing to do? Maybe I could use only ItemKey, and have Item to be taken from a sort of 'glossary data store'.
- [ ] We have to construct a more complex Aggregate from StorageQuery.quantityFor(ItemKey)? Now it returns the quantity as long. We could let the QueryModel construct a sort of 'Storage' Aggregate that could be the representation of the current status of the Storage.
